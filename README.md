# SprintBoard

Manual-first **DevOps & Cloud** project that ships a tiny app (static NGINX page + minimal FastAPI) to focus on **AWS, Kubernetes, security, observability, and cost control**. App stays intentionally small so you can master infra.

## Why this repo?
- Practice real **production-style** infra on a budget (k3s on EC2, TLS, Ingress, ECR, RDS later)
- Learn-by-doing: do it **manually first**, then codify with **Terraform/Helm/Argo CD** later
- Interview-ready runbooks and scenarios

## Initial scope (v0.0.1-manual)
- k3s on EC2 (single node), NGINX Ingress, cert-manager (DNS-01 with Route53)
- Public HTTPS endpoint: `app.<your-domain>`
- Minimal services:
  - **frontend**: NGINX serving a static ‚ÄúSprintBoard is Live‚Äù page
  - **api**: FastAPI with `/healthz` and `/echo`
